# Exercise Checklist

This checklist should help you keep track of your exercises. Remember that you have to hand in satisfactory solutions to at least *two-thirds* of the exercises. If you're part of the beginner track, this refers to two-thirds of section 4 (EDA) only. If you're part of the advanced track, you have to hand in at least two-thirds of  section 4 and 5. Hence, you'll need more than 66% in each of the two sections for a certificate.

**Part 1: Exploratory Data Analysis (Beginner + Advanced Tracks)**


**Part 2: Prediction Using Statistical Methods (motivated Beginner + Advanced Tracks)**
