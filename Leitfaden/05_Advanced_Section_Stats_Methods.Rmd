# Seasonality and Geographic Differences -- Application of Statistical Methods

## Merging Bees and Weather

The first part was hopefully easy for the more advanced of you. 
Let's continue with some more challanging exercises! We want to investigate how diseases and different climates affect our beloved bee populations. To that end, you now need to merge the two data sets "Bees" and "Weather".
Be careful to aggregate the weather data set wisely to quarterly data. It might not be clever to replace period-specific max / min values with a mean.

## Correlations

### Naive Approach

Do a simple correlations plot between variables of your interest. This could be lost colonies and different parasites and weather indicators. You could also create your own indication such as a temperature differential or interaction effects.

```{r, echo=FALSE, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE, fig.align="center", out.width = "100%"}
knitr::include_graphics("plot/Correlations using Pearson Method.jpg")
```

* We have a question for you: Why is a naive correlation matrix across states a terrible idea? Think for example about omitted variables and how information is lost when you aggregate fundamentally different groups.

### Statewise Correlations

Referring the the correlation matrix and aggregating fundamentally different states, it seems reasonable to look at statewise correlations. Choose a state and plot a  correlation, which you expect to have a reasonable correlation coefficient. Does your plot look like you expected it to be?


```{r, echo=FALSE, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE, fig.align="center", out.width = "100%"}
knitr::include_graphics("plot/State Correlations sorted by Latitude - Lost Colonies and Temperature ex Hawaii.jpg")
```

## Simple Linear Models for State Panel Data

### Exploiting Geographic Differences

You don't have to be a geographical pro to conclude that the state location is propably influencing the weather and thus the bees. Subset your data to explore geographical differences. You could work with latitude and	longitude values here. Run a linear regression model with variables of your interest. Since you have muliple subsets which you aim to compare a loop would be great to use. Compare the beta-value and p-value of your output. What other values are important to look at? 
Please frame your findings in a decent conclusion. 


### Seasonality

Next, not only geographical data might influence weather and bees but also our seasons. Now it is getting a bit challenging. Look for the states that do have 4 seasons . A quick Google Search will help you. Select those and run linear regressions per Season with variables of your interest. Here you could either look at the same variables over all 4 season or select individual variables per season.
