# Seasonality and Geographic Differences -- Application of Statistical Methods

## Merging Bees and Weather

The first part was hopefully easy for the more advanced of you. 
Let's continue with some more challanging exercises! We want to investigate how diseases and different climates affect our beloved bee populations. To that end, you now need to merge the two data sets "Bees" and "Weather".
Be careful to aggregate the weather data set wisely to quarterly data. It might not be clever to replace period-specific max / min values with a mean.

## Correlations

### Naive Approach

Do a simple correlations plot between variables of interest like lost colonies and different parasites and weather indicators. You could also create your own indication such as a temperature differential or interaction effects.

```{r, echo=FALSE, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE, fig.align="center", out.width = "100%"}
knitr::include_graphics("plot/Correlations using Pearson Method.jpg")
```

* Why is a naive correlation matrix across states a terrible idea? Think for example about omitted variables and how information is lost when you aggregate fundamentally different groups.

### Statewise Correlations


```{r, echo=FALSE, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE, fig.align="center", out.width = "100%"}
knitr::include_graphics("plot/State Correlations sorted by Latitude - Lost Colonies and Temperature ex Hawaii.jpg")
```
