# Exploratory Data Analysis

Before you can dive into the data, set up your programming environment.
This will be the place where the magic happens - all your coding will take place there.

::: {.tips .r data-latex="r"}
In your workspace on [RStudio Cloud](https://rstudio.cloud/projects), we have already uploaded an "assignment" for you (Template HoneyAndBees).
When you create a new project within the workspace *Class of '22 \| TechAcademy \| Data Science with R*, your workspace will open up.

We've already made some arrangements for you: The data sets you will be working with throughout the project are already available in your working directory.
We also created an RMarkdown file (a file that ends with `.Rmd` extension), with which you will be able to create a detailed report of your project.
You can convert that file into an HTML document when you have finished coding the project in R.
Open the file `Markdown_HoneyAndBees.Rmd` and see for yourself!
:::

::: {.tipsp .python data-latex="p"}
We recommend using [Google Colab](https://colab.research.google.com) for this project since it requires no particular setup, stores its notebooks to your Google Drive, and makes it easy for you to share them with your team members.

As an alternative to Google Colab, you might want to install Jupyter Notebook locally using the Anaconda distribution.
We will give you a more detailed step-by-step demo during the first coding meetup.
:::

Next up is importing the data sets. It's best to this *once* on the top
level of your notebook / script. You can always make copies and work on slices
afterwards.

## Exploring Honey and Bees Data

### Discovering Formats, Frequencies, and Fuck-ups
Let's start by looking at the bee & honey data. To start viewing the data you have just imported 
Have a look at the frequency of the data (is there a difference?)
Do you see any missing values or data entries that are different from the other entries?
What are the data formats? Look at the unit of every variable, can you make sense of the units?
Write down in a couple of sentences which errors you first notice and what could be an issue later in the project.
No worries, there is no right or wrong.

::: {.tips .r data-latex="r"}
You can import the data directly from your working directory. Use `head()`, `str()`,
or `class()` to get an overview.
:::

::: {.tipsp .python data-latex="p"}
You can feed the links to the respective data files above to a method of the 
pandas package (you might want to specify the index column).
Check out the resulting `pd.DataFrame` instance with the `head()` method and 
the `dtpyes` attribute. You can also dig into a specific column with `describe()`.

### Give some overall statements 

MÃ¼ssen wir vlt vorher die Daten Typen umwandeln lassen.

Lets stick with the honey data. Since you have already gotten a feeling by now, it would be interesting to indicate some outstanding features: 
* Which state had the most producing colonies ever and in which year? Anything special about that state?
* What state had the lowest price for honey. How low was it?
* What is the total Honey production for 2016?


## Data Cleaning Exercises and Useful Transformations

### Convert from pounds to kg and prices to $/kg
As you can see in the column names, the honey data set is either in pounds as we are dealing with a 
US Dataset. However, we naturally don't understand pounds, so we would like to replace a pound measure into the metric system.
*Tipp*: While you are at it, you might want to give your new variable in kg a new, shorter name with less spaces in it ...


### Task 3: Have a look at your column values. Some columns now have irrelevant long decimal numbers. To simplify your data frame, round up to the decimal place you prefer (explain what decimal place you chose!). 
*Tipp*: 



### Task 4: Bees data set: year into date format, 
since we want to merge honey and the bees data set, we will now spend some time cleaning the bees data set.
if it helps you,look at the bees data set using the appropriate commands (please do now show us in the markdown)
Difference: year format in quarters!, therefore we need to work on the data before merging
might have learned that in datacamp: check whether the var is in a date format with the command class():
if you the var is not in date format yet, you can use the lubridate package to transform "years" into a date format. You will need this later!



### Task 5: So far you converted Years into an appropiate date format. But look at the other colums: They are numbers but are they also numeric? Check on all colums so you dont miss on one!
For further calculations numbers need to be converted into a numeric factor. Can you do so?
Tipp: also here a loop is the best approach. 


### Task 6: Calculate the percentage of lost colonies & round, why id you decide to round the way you have to?


### Task 7: Look bees and missing values, decide on how you want to treat them and give us a detailed explanation why you have decided to treat the missing values

Let the participants freely describe what they see and how they decide, link to the DataCamp course dealing with missing values
they should do that for the following task, keeping in mind that we want to summarize means!
find patters for missing values and decide how you want to treat NAs


### Task 8: mean of all the quarters of one year t

As you can see now, quarterly date has disappeared and we only have years left. Please mind how you are rounding your means, give us a short reasoning why
you are rounding the way you are rounding and a short data table so we can check whether your data is correct


###Task 9: prepare to merge honey and bees into one data frame
to merge give your "bees" data columns appropriate names (we recommend names where empty spaces are replaced with an underscore "_"), if you have not done so
for the honey data set please do the same


### Task 10: merge honey and bee dataset and explain us the process of how the way you have decided to merge your data works and what you needed to do
in order to merge the data sets (hint: by what are you merging?)
Wir implizieren hier, dass die Staaten sich reduzieren, den Teilnehmern am besten in die guide schreiben


### Task 11: Bar Plot for all States (starting bee colonies = number of bee poplation, sorted)
The participants can decide for themselves here whether they want to use the mean for all years or plot the graphs for just one year
Plotted here for 2020, not the prettist version, but will make it prettier once approved
```{r, echo=FALSE, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE, fig.align="center", out.width = "100%"}
knitr::include_graphics("plot/Starting Colonies in January 2021.jpg")
```


### Task 12: Split a subset for data between the X different Team members (we have 40 States) (ungraded)

### Task 13: Boxplot aggregated for year: Honey Production, Parasite: Varroa Mite, Precipitation , Bee Colonies (6 boxen)

### Task 14: Heatmap of Bee Populations

### Task 15: Map with state popups
