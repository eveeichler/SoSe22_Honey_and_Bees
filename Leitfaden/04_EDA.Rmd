::: {.tipsp .python data-latex="p"}
We recommend using [Google Colab](https://colab.research.google.com) for this project since it requires no particular setup, stores its notebooks to your Google Drive, and makes it easy for you to share them with your team members.

As an alternative to Google Colab, you might want to install Jupyter Notebook locally using the Anaconda distribution.
We will give you a more detailed step-by-step demo during the first coding meetup.
